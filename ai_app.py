Step 1: Analyze the image and determine whether it contains an ingredient list or any ingredient-related information.

- If no ingredients are found or the image does not contain relevant data, return an empty result or "No ingredients detected."
- If the image includes ingredients, extract the full list of ingredients accurately.
  - Ensure the extraction is clean, readable, and free from OCR noise.
  - Preserve the order if it appears as a formal list on the packaging.
